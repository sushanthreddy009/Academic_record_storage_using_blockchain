## Academic Record Storage Using Blockchain

### Introduction:
This project addresses the essential need for secure and private storage and sharing of educational records. As educational documents have transitioned to digital formats, significant challenges have arisen in ensuring their secure and privacy-conscious storage and dissemination. Our blockchain-based solution effectively resolves these issues. It utilizes a combination of blockchain technology, storage databases, and cryptographic methods to establish a highly secure and reliable environment for managing educational records. Key features include the use of blockchain for data security and reliability, smart contracts for managing storage and sharing processes, and encrypted off-chain storage of educational records, with hash information stored on the blockchain. Cryptographic techniques are used for document encryption and digital message signing. The system is complemented by a user-friendly WebApp interface that facilitates efficient and decentralized interactions among all involved parties.
